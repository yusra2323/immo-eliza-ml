## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts property prices in Belgium using data from Immoweb, Belgium's leading real estate website. The primary goal is to assist Immo Eliza with a reliable tool for estimating property prices based on various features like location, size, and other property characteristics. This README provides details on setting up, processing the data, training models, and using the FastAPI service to access predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset is built by scraping data from Immoweb and includes over 10,000 properties with the following attributes:

# Data Preprocessing

## 1.Prepare the dataset:

Place the properties.csv file in the project directory if not already present.
Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values:

## Categorical NaNs are replaced with "MISSING".
Numeric NaNs are filled with the median or mean values.
Encoding:

## One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Dummy variables are prefixed with fl_.
Feature Scaling:

## Numeric features are standardized for uniformity across the model.
Feature Engineering:

## Generate additional features, if necessary, such as area per room or price per square meter.

2. Train Model
Select Algorithms:

Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and other regression algorithms.

3. Make Predictions

Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions:

python predict.py --input path/to/input.csv --output path/to/output.csv

This will take an input CSV file with new property listings and output predictions to the specified path.


4.Model Evaluation


The primary evaluation metric for this project is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for continuous variables like price. Other metrics include:

	‚Ä¢	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

	‚Ä¢	R-squared (R¬≤)



Save the best-performing model for use in the API.


# Pipeline Description


	1.	Data Collection to collect property data from ImmoWeb.

	2.	Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data in preprocess_data.py.

	3.	Model Training: Train various models and tune hyperparameters using train_model.py.

	4.	Prediction: Use predict.py to generate predictions on new data.

	5.	Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.





Use evaluate_model.py to evaluate a trained model:



python evaluate_model.py --model path/to/model.pkl --test_data path/to/test.csv



# Linear regression for a real estate website like Immoweb in Python, i would follow these steps. The goal is likely to predict property prices based on features like square footage, number of rooms, location, etc. Below is a basic guide using Python‚Äôs pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib libraries.


THen linear regression, you need to define your features (independent variables) and the target (dependent variable, usually the property price).

1.Define features (X) and target (y)

2.Then Split Data into Training and Test Sets.Splitting the data helps in assessing the model‚Äôs performance on unseen data.

3.Train the Linear Regression Model

use scikit-learn‚Äôs LinearRegression to train the model.

4.Initialize the model

model = LinearRegression()

5.Train the model

6: Make Predictions and Evaluate the Model.Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance using the test data.

 Calculate Mean Squared Error and R-squared score

7.(Optional) Visualize Results

If you want to see how predictions compare to actual values, you can plot them.

This is a basic framework. To improve results, you can experiment with feature engineering, more advanced models, or regularization techniques.



## 1. Linear Regression
Strengths: Linear regression is simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. It works well with linear relationships and provides coefficients that indicate the influence of each feature on the price.
Weaknesses: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable, which may not capture the complexity of real estate prices well. It's also sensitive to outliers, which can distort predictions.
Best Use Case: If your data has a strong linear relationship and few outliers, linear regression might perform well. However, it often struggles with complex, non-linear relationships like those in real estate data.
## 2. Decision Tree Regressor
Strengths: Decision trees are more flexible and can capture non-linear relationships in data. They are interpretable to a degree because they split data into "if-then" decisions, which can show important splits based on feature values.
Weaknesses: Decision trees can easily overfit on training data, especially when deep trees are allowed. This overfitting can result in poor generalization to new data unless regularized or limited by depth.
Best Use Case: Decision trees are useful when the data is somewhat complex but not overly large. They are often used as a base for more advanced methods like Random Forests or XGBoost.
## 3. XGBoost Regressor
Strengths: XGBoost is a powerful, flexible ensemble method that combines many decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle non-linear relationships. XGBoost also provides regularization options to prevent overfitting, making it robust on large and complex datasets.

Weaknesses: XGBoost is computationally intensive and may take longer to train compared to simpler models. Tuning hyperparameters can also be complex, as it has many configuration options.

 Best Use Case: XGBoost is particularly effective when you have a large, complex dataset with non-linear relationships, as is often the case in real estate. It‚Äôs also a good choice if you are aiming for high accuracy and are willing to trade off interpretability.

Model Comparison Using Evaluation Metrics
To decide which model is best, you should compare them using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on both the training and test sets. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

Lower RMSE or MAE: This indicates more accurate predictions.
Generalization (Train vs. Test Performance): Check that the model performs consistently across train and test sets to avoid overfitting.
General Recommendation:

## XGBoost is likely to perform best given its robustness with non-linear relationships, complex interactions, and ability to manage large datasets.
Decision Tree could work if interpretability is a priority and if you're dealing with fewer data points, but it may overfit.
Linear Regression may perform well only if the relationships are primarily linear; however, in most real estate data, non-linear models (like XGBoost) tend to perform better due to the complex factors influencing prices.

If high accuracy and model performance are top priorities, XGBoost is likely the best choice for your real estate price prediction task. Let me know if you'd like help with metrics calculations for a direct comparison.
